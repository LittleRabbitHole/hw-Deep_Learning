### Homework for the Deep Learning course on Udacity

[This course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730) introduces the use of tensorflow and its applications in CNN and RNN. The iPython Notebooks are my homework for this class, practicing CNN for image classification, RNN for work generation, and Word to Vector model from sample text. Models and parameters may not be optimal.
