### Homework for the Deep Learning course on Udacity

[This course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730) introduces the use of tensorflow and its applications in CNN, word to vector model, and RNN. The iPython Notebooks here are my homework for this class, practicing [CNN for image classification](./4_convolutions.ipynb), [RNN for word generation](./6_lstm.ipynb), and [Word to Vector model](./5_word2vec.ipynb) from sample text.

If you got stuck in the last problem in homework #6, the sequence to sequence model, I have implemented two versions here. Please let me know if you find this helpful or have any suggestion to improve those models!
